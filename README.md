### Waifu Shopping and Trading Center, and Duelling Ground

Who does not want to get those really kawaii waifus!? Pick your waifus from the dungeon and transfer them to your locker. You're guaranteed to find all the waifu you need (guarantee void if waifu needed which is not in database, in which case, lodge your complaint in the support server, and the waifu will be added within a few minutes to hours)

(NOTE: Waifu duelling feature under construction. Will be made available to beta testers in one week, and to normal people in 2-3 weeks)

### MyAnimeList.net Integration

So that you can show off the anime you have watched to other peeps and make them jelly. Or check the number of days you've been watching anime for, and confirm you are a NEET. Or just plain ol' anime search.

### Nyaa.Si Integration

Just you can directly get your anime torrent files from Discord (cause we all know, we spend 108% of our time on Discord)! Use `=nyaa` to use this feature.

### GIF Reactions

Reacting with GIFs is all the rage nowadays, ESPECIALLY for those poor non-Discord-Nitro guys. From `=shrug` to `=satania` to `=jojo` to just `=gif <custom reaction>`. And many many more reactions... (See `=help` for more).

### Very Very Super Duper Fun Stuff

Contains many miscellaneous ranging from everything to everything. From `=avatarurl` to `=whois` to `=gif thonk` to Urban Dictionary search to Chuck Norris jokes.
Or cook someone with `=cook`. Or fake-tweet something with `=tweet`. And this is just the tip of the cone (no, I am not going to say iceberg. Let me be cooler/lamer). See `=help` for more!
Also, I love reaction polls. Use `=poll`.

### Some Mod Features 

Like the purge command. Or the awesome looking welcome and leave messages (not configured by default, use `=help`). They look soooo cool!
Or you know, that annoying moment when you want a colored role that is not in the server? Or when you want to show off to new members with cool sounding role names? Then this bot is TOTALLY suited for you. For the former, you have `=customrole` and for the latter you have `=paidroles`.

### Ear Bleeding High Quality Lag Free Music (Only for donators, aka costs 1$ per month per server)

For all your music demands. Forget Spotify, use this bot. Or, maybe not. But still great for listening to music with others.
Seriously though, you'll love the audio (T&C: Void if song is not good/~~made by JB~~).
